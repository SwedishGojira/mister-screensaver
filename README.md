# Mister Rom Screensaver
This is just a quick test to see if I can have a random rom start after a predefined period of time. My goal is to have random games play every 5 minutes once the script is activated.
Usage:

Copy nes.txt and nes-random-game.sh to Scripts folder

Make sure you're using the Everdrive Pack under "/media/fat/Games/@NES{}.zp"

In your MISTer.ini, make sure bootcore is disabled.
