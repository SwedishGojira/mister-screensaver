# Mister Rom Screensaver
This is just a quick test to see if I can have a random game start after a predefined period of time. My goal is to have random games play every 5 minutes once the script is activated. At this stage you can only launch one random game through the Scripts folder.

# Usage:

Copy nes.txt and nes-random-game.sh to Scripts folder

Make sure you're using the Everdrive Pack under "/media/fat/Games/NES/@NES{}.zip"

Also, make sure boot0.rom and boot1.rom are in the folder /media/fat/Games/NES

In your MISTer.ini, make sure bootcore is disabled.
